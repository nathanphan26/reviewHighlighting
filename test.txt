I Love their falafel sandwiches, go early there is always line at lunchtime during the week, but it goes pretty quick.
I've also had the gyros sandwich, which I honestly have only had once. Like I said previously, the falafel sandwich is just too good. What's different about Falafel Drive-In's gyros is that the meat is cubed--not sliced. I also like the seasoning used for the gyros meat.
Falafel's Drive-In is one popular place--its menu is a cross between Middle East-inspired street food and American classics (hot dogs and the like).
The food itself was fine. We ordered one of the specials, a large falafel sandwich and banana shake, a large side of fries, and then a falafel salad. The falafel itself really is great and with the red sauce on the side, it is awesome. However, the salad was just really plain and bland.
